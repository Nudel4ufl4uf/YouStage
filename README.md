# YouStage

The YouStage Apk is a prototype based on an student project in early 2020. 
It should help me to get to know Flutter itself a bit better ans work a lot more with Git. 

## Description

The project was ment to be a Platform for a variety of Artist who can not perform in their usual way due to Covid-19.
It is ment ot be a Platform like Twitch but with more interactive features for espacially artist. 
Most of the requirements can be seen in the "Anforderungsanalyse" in youstage/Prototype.

After the Project broke down due to semester ending in mid 2020 it was my idea to bring it alife in form of a small Prototype. The full Prototype can be seen under youstage/Prototype.
